This is rrep, a replacement utility with support for recursive
directory processing. It searches for a regular expression and
replaces it by a string in the file and directory list that starts
after the second argument that is not an option.

Example: rrep 'hello world' 'Hello, World!' menu.h main.c

rrep is yet another rpl-type string replacement utility. Its goals
are ease of use, robustness and wide deployability. The only
dependency is the standard C library.
