This is rrep, a recursive string replacement utility. It searches for a regular
expression and replaces it by a string in the file and directory list that
starts after the second argument that is not an option. Directories are
processed recursively.

Example: rrep 'hello world' 'Hello, World!' menu.h main.c

rrep is yet another rpl-type string replacement utility. Its goals are ease of
use, robustness and wide deployability. The only dependency is the standard C
library. GNU extensions are not required.
