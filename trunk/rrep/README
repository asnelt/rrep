This is rrep, a recursive string replacement utility. It replaces its first
command line argument by its second argument in the file and directory list
that starts with its third argument. Directories are processed recursively.

Example: rrep 'hello world' 'Hello, World!' menu.h main.c

rrep is yet another rpl-type string replacement utility. Its goals are ease of
use, robustness and wide deployability. The only dependency is the standard C
library. GNU extensions are not required.
