This is rrep, a replacement utility with support for recursive
directory processing. It searches for a regular expression and
replaces it by a string in the file and directory list that starts
after the second argument that is not an option.

Usage: rrep [OPTION]... PATTERN REPLACEMENT [FILE]...
Replace PATTERN by REPLACEMENT in each FILE or standard input.
PATTERN is, by default, a basic regular expression (BRE).
REPLACEMENT may contain the special character & to refer to that
portion of the pattern space which matched, and the special
escapes \1 through \9 to refer to the corresponding matching
sub-expressions in PATTERN.
Example: rrep 'hello world' 'Hello, World!' menu.h main.c

With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input. Exit status
is 1 if any error occurs, 0 otherwise.

rrep is yet another rpl-type string replacement utility. Its goals
are ease of use, robustness and wide deployability. The only
dependency is the standard C library.
